# Getting Started with Create React App


Development:

Implement a mock login page with a simple form and hardcoded login functionality. Use Credentials = "demo" and Password = "password".

Apply validation in the login form that will be guided by alert messages.

Upon successful login, display an alert message, and after clicking "OK," redirect the user to the dashboard.

Design the dashboard to present data in a tabular form with a button positioned at the upper center.

If the user wishes to visualize data in a graphical format, they can select columns and click the "Graph" option. Various graph formats will be available for the user to choose from.

To view a comparison of all successful missions, the user can click on the "All Missions Success Ratio" button.

Technology Used:

Utilize React.js for frontend development.

Implement AG-Grid for rendering the table.

Incorporate a charting library such as AG-Chart to create the chart(s).

Fetch and display the provided data.

Use Bootstrap-5 for modals.

Employ react-router-dom for navigation.

Create the login JSX with CSS styling.
